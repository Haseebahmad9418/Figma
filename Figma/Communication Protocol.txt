UI Application Communication Protocol

- UI application will run outside ROS environment
- UDP protocol is used for the communication between UI application and ROS environment.
- 2 UDP ports are used: 1 for ROS bag recording, another for status updates.
- UI application will implement UDP client and communicate with a UDP server application in the ROS environment for ROS bag recording.
- UI application will implement a UDP server to receive updates from the application that subscribes to the ROS topics and report this data back to the UI application(UDPserver).
